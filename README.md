# un-voting-patterns

why we chose the specific un categories:
- most votes within our topics
- categories mostly don't target certain countries -> votes from whole categories won't be skewed based on bilateral relationship
- minimal overlap within topics (ex. was going to add right to development but all 20 of those resolutions were also categorized under human rights advancement so I just didn't add right to development)
